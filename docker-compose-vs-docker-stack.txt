Conceptually, both files serve the same purpose - deployment and configuration of your containers on docker engines.

Docker-compose tool was created first and its purpose is "for defining and running
multi-container Docker applications" on a single docker engine. (see docker compose overview )

You use docker-compose up to create/update your containers, networks, volumes and so on.

Where Docker Stack is used in Docker Swarm (Docker's orchestration and scheduling tool) and, therefore, 
it has additional configuration parameters (i.e. replicas, deploy, roles) that are not needed on a single docker engine.

The stack file is interpreted by docker stack command. This command can be invoked from a docker swarm manager only.

File naming
For docker-compose up the default file name is docker-compose.yml
if no alternate file name is specified using -f (see the compose reference).
It is common to use this default name and run the command without an argument.

For docker stack deploy there is no default file given in the docker stack deploy reference. 
You can use whatever name you want, however here are three conventions:

use docker-stack.yml, as used in the official Docker for Beginners Ch.3: Deploying an app to a Swarm.
use docker-cloud.yml, as used in the Docker Cloud Stack YML reference for the Docker Cloud service.
use docker-compose.yml -- the old default name for the Compose file format.
